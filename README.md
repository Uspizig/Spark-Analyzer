### Thermal Performance
Safety and efficiency are paramount. We took a thermal image of the board under these testing conditions to ensure that all components remained within safe temperature limits. The results were impressive: the entire board stayed cool, with the warmest component being the ESP32 microcontroller, which only reached around 40Â°C.
